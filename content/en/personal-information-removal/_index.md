In the wake of a new campaign, or viral moment on the internet, activists can be uniquely vulnerable.
Your personal information– your legal name, address, phone number, email, and even social media
handles– are collected by consumer marketing firms and just a Google search away from bad actors
using that information to harass you. 

## Peoplesearch Engine Removal
However, you can preemptively remove your data from peoplesearch databases. While it can seem
daunting, every website from which you remove your personal information lowers your chances of
having that information used to harass you. 

To check for your exposure, try searching for your legal name, along with the city in which you
live. Then try your name with your street. (Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), so that
Google does not track your search and start suggesting your residence address as an autofill for
your name.)

You can either remove the information yourself, or pay for a professional service like
[DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/) ($129/year as of June 2022). While not practically difficult,
this can be emotionally stressful work that can be easier to perform with a friend or small group of
trusted activists.

For more information on DeleteMe, see [this 2024 review from PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/abine-deleteme).

Michael Bazzell has compiled a free and comprehensive list of peoplesearch engines, with
step-by-step instructions for each. The workbook is available in both [PDF](https://inteltechniques.com/data/workbook.pdf)
and [HTML](https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html) formats, so you can print it out, or work from
the list online.

The workbook is 32 pages, with six peoplesearch engines per page. If you spend 15-20 minutes per
day, it should take you about a month to complete, or 8-10 hours total.

## PimEyes
You should remove yourself from [PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com). PimEyes is a commercially available facial recognition database. One can upload a photo of someone, and PimEyes will scan the web to find matching results. Pro-Israel protesters in the Boston area have identified some pro-Palestine protesters, most likely using PimEyes, and have targeted them for harassment.

## VOIP Numbers
If you’re an organizer, you’re probably regularly in contact with people you don’t know well, via a
variety of services. If you have to give your number out– for example, in a press release or even a
Signal thread– consider using a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) number not linked to your real
name by a peoplesearch engine, so that you don’t have to change your number should you start
receiving harassment.

[Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/u/0/about) is a free option that will work for this purpose.
As of January 2022, [MySudo](https://mysudo.com/) offers a
two-week free trial of their app that will also work for this purpose. After that, plans start at
[99 cents/month](https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020179513-What-do-I-get-with-my-SudoGo-paid-subscription-)
for three email addresses and one phone number, with up to 30 minutes of talk time and
100 text messages with non-MySudo users. Three phone numbers with 200 minutes and 300 text
messages/month is [$4.99/month](https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019979314-What-do-I-get-with-my-SudoPro-paid-subscription-).
